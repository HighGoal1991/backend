# How can I contribute?

Lime is in very early development. We know that the code has issues right now, and we would love for other people to help out with fixing issues and implementing new features. Ideally, if you want a bug fixed or a feature implemented, fork the code, fix it, and submit a pull request when you're happy with the implementation.

At this point in the project we need pull requests more than bug reports, so please only open new issues politely and judiciously.

Thanks!
