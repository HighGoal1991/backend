### 1. The issues list is for development purposes only.

All issues reported here should result in **code being changed, added and/or removed**.

For support requests, please use [limetext/support](https://github.com/limetext/support) instead.


### 2. Issues should be opened up in the correct repository.

All issues reported here should result in code being changed, added and/or removed **in *this* repository**. If the issue relates to a different package, please file it there. There are a number of supporting packages maintained by us, which can be found [here](https://github.com/limetext).


### 3. Feature requests belong here, unless they can be implemented via a plugin.

If the feature can be implemented via a plugin it fails by proxy to satisfy [#2](https://github.com/limetext/lime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#2-issues-should-be-openened-up-in-the-correct-repository).


### 4. Bug reports belong here.

Bug reports should include a description of current behaviour and the expected behaviour in cases where this isn't obvious.

User errors where the error does not result in a code change count as support and fail to satisfy [#1](https://github.com/limetext/lime/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#1-the-issues-list-is-for-development-purposes-only).
