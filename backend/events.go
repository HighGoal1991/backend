	// Context is just a string identifier, an optional comparison operator, an optional operand, and an optional
	// match_all boolean. The data of the context is optionally provided together with a key binding and the key's
	// action will only be considered if the context conditions are met.
	//
	// Exactly how these values are interpreted is up to the individual context handlers, which may be fully
	// customized by implementing the callback in a plugin.
	//
	// For instance pressing the key 'j' will have a different meaning when in a VI command mode emulation
	// and when in a VI insert mode emulation. A plugin would then define two key binding entries for 'j',
	// describe the key binding context to be able to discern which action is appropriate when 'j' is then pressed.
